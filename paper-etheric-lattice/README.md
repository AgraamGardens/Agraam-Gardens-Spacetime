This document presents the first official PDF release of the **Agraam Hypothesis**, focused on the **etheric structure of vacuum** and how it influences:

- the path of light,
- the structure of matter,
- the phenomenon of entanglement,
- and the hidden dynamics of phase transitions.

> “The lattice does not follow space — space follows the lattice.”

## 📎 Summary

- Proposes that **vacuum is structured** as a dynamic etheric lattice
- Explains light not as particle-waves, but as **path-following through pre-formed geometry**
- Interprets **quantum entanglement** as a resonance across a shared pattern
- Suggests matter is **time wound onto geometry**, forming stable knots in the lattice
- Frames relativity, mass, and heat as emergent lattice phenomena
