# ⚡ Nikola Tesla and the Secret Geometry of the Ether

> A speculative and visionary interpretation of Tesla’s legacy — through the lens of the **etheric lattice model**.

This short paper explores the idea that Nikola Tesla was intuitively tapping into the **structured vacuum**, long before modern physics began to hint at such geometry. His experiments with wireless transmission, high-frequency fields, and radiant energy may point not just to electrical phenomena — but to a deeper **pattern-based field** that underlies space itself.

We suggest that Tesla’s work resonates with the **Agraam Hypothesis**, especially with the notion of **semantic structures in the vacuum** that allow both information and energy to move in non-classical ways.
