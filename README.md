## ðŸ“– Abstract

This repository presents the first theoretical cycle of the Agraam Universe â€” a model where space is structured as an etheric lattice, and time flows through it like a vibrational thread.  
In this framework:

- Light follows tension lines of the lattice  
- Mass is the result of temporal flow compression  
- Phase transitions and relativity emerge from lattice distortion

The project combines metaphysical intuition with a physically-inspired structure, and aims to bridge scientific modeling with symbolic insight.
