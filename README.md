**Visual and theoretical model of spacetime based on etheric lattice dynamics and time flow compression.**  
Created by Sergei Gontsarenko (2025), Tallinn, Estonia.

## 📖 Abstract

This repository presents the first theoretical cycle of the Agraam Universe — a model where space is structured as an etheric lattice, and time flows through it like a vibrational thread.  
In this framework:

- Light follows tension lines of the lattice  
- Mass is the result of temporal flow compression  
- Phase transitions and relativity emerge from lattice distortion

The project combines metaphysical intuition with a physically-inspired structure, and aims to bridge scientific modeling with symbolic insight.

## 🔮 Mission

To open a multidimensional window into the real structure of reality.  
To bridge scientific reasoning with inner knowing.  
To say: *You’re not alone. Reality has structure. And we’re ready to explore it.*
